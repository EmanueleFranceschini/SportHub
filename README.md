The Web App is a SPA built with React retrieving data asynchronously from an API through a  
restAPI built with Node.js and Express.

## Installation

Start by cloning or downloading the remote repository.  
See more here: [GitHub Docs Cloning Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github)

To set up the restAPI on the server side make sure to have **node** on your machine and to be  
in the **backend** repository. Then go ahead and run the following commands in the terminal:  

  `npm install`
  `node .`  
  
Now the server should be running at http://localhost:5000

Let's proceed and setup the frontend side. In order to do that make sure to be in the **root** of  
the repository, then run the following commands in the terminal:  

  `npm install`
  `npm start`  

This may take a while. After it's complete, you should see the website running on your localhost default PORT.


(Make sure to update the fetch URLs in `./components/Context.js` in order to be able to  
test any changes you may have made to the restAPI)
